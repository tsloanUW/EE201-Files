# About Me

Hi, I am Tyler, and this is my first document for GitHub using git. 

This is the **first** time I have taken a class like EE 201 where it exists only in a lab setting. The three hour block seems scary but overall, the class is chill.

## Interesting tidbits
I previously took CSE 123, and one of the assignments tasked us to implement basic functionalities of git using linked nodes and linked lists.
